<p>This is the lecture notes taken from the 2020 lectures on topological order [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.koushare.com/live/topology">https://www.koushare.com/live/topology</a>], the references are important for future study.</p>
<h1>孔良：Infinite more is more different</h1>
<p>Try to give a categorical unification of many notions in quantum many body problem, quantum gravity, quantum entanglement. The “inifity” is essentially different from finite, where new mathematical structures emerge. The nature of strong interacting systems in quantum many body also adopt this feature.</p>
<p>This talk(rather than a lecture) is inviting, a more detailed version can be found in [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05565">https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05565</a>]</p>

<h1>王晨杰：Quantum anomaly and bulk-boundary correspondence</h1>
<p>The anomaly in QFT is a powerful tool in CMP. The anomalous topological order(surface) must be attached to some topological nontrivial topological order(SPT/SET). The anomaly is classfied into several types: 't Hooft, Gravitational, gauge-gravitational mixed, invertible/non-invertible(w/o GSD,w/o anyon)</p>
<p>'t Hooft anomaly basicly means the global symmetry can’t be gauged, turning on the probing(external) gauge field, we will obtain anomalous gauge response. This anomaly means the theory can’t have a lattice regularization(for example the Nilsen-Ninomiya theorem/fermion doubling). The anomalous theory can’t exist alone, but being the boudanry of some bulk topological order which is topologically nontrivial. Thus the whole space is anomaly free, and the bulk theory is protected/enriched by the corresponding theory.</p>
<p>Gravitational anomaly is related to the topology, which is manifested by coupling to a external gravitational field(metric field), i.e, curving the spacetime. This is also related to the chiral central charge, which is manifested when the CFT description is set up.</p>

<h1>顾正澄：Topological order and ground state wave function</h1>
<p>Viewed from ground state, Topological order phase is a gapped quantum phase that can’t be deformed(using generalized local unitary transformation) into a tensor product state. This also means these phases have long-range entanglement(but don’t have long-range order,all correlation functions decaying). With symmetry, it’s a SET state. There’s related SPT state, which have no intrinsic T.O, but can’t be deformed into a tensor product state(independent atomic insulators) perserving symmetry.</p>
<p>The construction of specific ground state for 2D T.O is using lattice models(this can’t be easily done for chiral T.O,like FQH)(From field theoretical point, this is constructing lattice gauge theory of TQFT), the construction will involve the wavefunction renormalization operations(related to retriangulation of lattice,etc) since ar RG fixed point, only the topology matters, then there will be consistency conditions for these operations together with gauge choices. These then defines possible data of a G.S wavefunction at least for bosonic case(having extra saturate condition). These data(solutions) define a unitary tensor category.</p>
<p>This view is related to the excitation view, since the algebra of anyons(anyon diagramatics or TQFT/CFT algebra) and the algebra of the Ribbon operators also define a unitary tensor category, possibly with more datas.</p>
<p>Models include Toric code, double semion(related in cohomology), quantum double, twisted quantum double(Dijkgraaf-Witten), string-net(Levin-Wen,Tuaev-Viro), etc. The construction of fermionic topological order lattice models are rather hard, which can be studied using anomaly.</p>
<p>GS wavefunction can also be constructed using TQFT/CFT, for example the Laughlin wavefunction(chiral/holomorphic) of FQHE, and Moore-Reed, etc.</p>

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
<ul>
<li>Algebraic topology is the interplay between continuous and discrete mathematics, for topological/geometrical continuum, A.T allows their realizations to be of an algebraic nature.</li>
<li>Classical A.T consists of construction and use functors to study/extract-information from topological category. Two important views are homology and homotopy. These implies the category of topological spaces has itself a kind of hidden algebraic structure and can been manifested only in techniques of A.T, these properties can not been obtained using simply point-set topology.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Topological space</h1>
<p>This chapter serve as a set up of some point-set topological notions, the most important notions are quotient space(quotient set with quotient topology) and transformation groups.</p>
<h2 id="basic-notions">Basic notions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Topological space is defined axiomatically with open sets, dually closed sets. Related notions including: closure(also defining dense subset), interior, boundary, etc. There’s notion of topological basis, also a weaker one known subbasis. There’s also subspaces, with subspace/induced topology defined on subset.</li>
<li>There are many topological structure can be defined. We then have the notion of coarser/finer topology. The morphisms are continuous maps defined via open sets, the morphisms are usually refered to as open/close morphism. The isomorphism in TOP is homeomorphism, we have to make sure the inverse is also continous(a morphism).</li>
<li>The notion of (open) neighbourhood is usually used, it is used to define continuity at some point. This notion is more useful in metric spaces, with topology defined respect to the metric, using open neighbourhoods. This type of topology is more related to analysis.</li>
<li>There are some properties we can attach to a topological space. Separation axioms have four types: Hausdorff(separated), (complete) regular, normal. Another one is (local) compactness(defined using open coverings).</li>
<li>Associated with compactness is the technique of compactification, most used one is known as one-point compactification. The proper morphism is associated with compactness.</li>
<li>There’s theorem implying locally compact set in Hausdorff space is locally closed. Locally closed set in locally compact space is locally compact.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many theorems related to openness, Hausdorffness, compactness, etc in the literature, they seem not that important to me.</p>
<ul>
<li>Associated with morphisms we have notions of sections, in topological context they are assumed to be continuous. Same for rectraction.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="categorical-constructions">Categorical constructions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Product of topological spaces is defined with product topology on product of sets. The product topology is the coarsest topology making the projections continuous. The universal properties in this book is frequently framed as “the unique(by construction from universal properties in SET) map is continuous if the associated ones are”. This is just checking the definition is indeed a morphism, this is important and we should also check well-defineness.</li>
<li>Dually we have coproduct which is refered to as topological sum. The subspace topology of components is the original ones, this means they are open in the sum.</li>
<li>Finer constructions are fiber product and fiber coproduct, the former is refered to as pull back defined with subspace topology, the latter is refered to as push out defined by quotient topology via coproduct morphism.</li>
<li>There’s notion of embedding, this is common in describing the topological object in terms of solution set of equations, they are defined with subspace topology. The embedding is of categorical nature</li>
<li>The quotient space is important, it express the idea of pasting points by identifying them with equivalence relations usually through morphisms. Specificly the quotient topology is defined via surjective map, equivalently canonical projections to quotient sets. This morphism is known as identification or quotient map.</li>
<li>Associted with quotient is the idea of constructing larger spaces by pasting smaller pieces. These process will finally need quotient, moding out some equivalence relation, this quotient process is intuitively identifying some structures in common, thus pasting different pieces together. Specific example include adjunction space, which is also a special case of push out of inclusion.</li>
<li>More generally, we have the notion of clutching, the definition is rather subtle, involving labeled subsets and bijections. The bijections define the notion of pasting, the datum lead to equivalence relations on disjiont sum(largest set)between points comes from different pieces. By quotienting we have well defined spaces and injections identifying different pieces. The bijections serve for transition between different pieces pasting them together.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="topological-groups">Topological groups</h2>
<ul>
<li>A topological group is a group with topological structure defined on set making the inverse and multiplication continous. The left action of group on itself is known as left transition and is a homeomorphism. Examples include matrice groups some of them are identified with topological spaces like n-sphere, n-torus, etc. Notions like subspace and quotient can be defined.</li>
<li>Group action of topological group on topological spaces define category G-TOP, consisting of G-spaces(like G-module, G-set) and equivariant morphisms(G-map). There’s related notions like orbit space by quotienting out the G action, stabilizer fixed point set, etc.</li>
<li>The equivariant continuous maps between topological spaces induce natrually continuous maps between corresponding G-spaces.</li>
<li>Equivariant homotopy or G-homotopy is defined as a homotopy such that at all time the morphism is a G-map.</li>
<li>The quotient space is defined on quotient set, the quotient space may not be a quotient group. The quotient space is defined with natural G-action, it is refered to as homogeneous space. It’s important in geometry.</li>
<li>By orbit-stabilizer theorem, the homogeneous space constructed by mod out the some stabilizer is identified with the orbit(transitive) we usually refer the latter. Important examples include sphere, projective spaces, Grassmann manifolds, Stiefel manifolds.</li>
<li>The homogeneous G-spaces with the mod out subgroup closed in G together with G-maps form orbit category.</li>
<li>The action on real/complex vector space is known as (G-modules) real/complex representation if the translations are linear maps.</li>
<li>Given a right G-space and a left G-space we can construct product with a left G action. Then by quotienting the action we obtain a orbit space. This constuction is important.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Lecture 1,2:</h1>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation:</h2>
<ul>
<li>CFT provide good effective description of systems at/near criticality(2nd phase transition point), near which we have interesting phenomena including long-range correlation, scaling invariance, etc.</li>
<li>CFT is the fixed point of RG, which implies all other QFTs are perturbation(approximation) to CFTs, they are also cut-off independent.</li>
<li>CFT can be made more mathematical rigorous, there are roughly 3 different formulation, haven’t been unified yet.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-cft">What is CFT:</h2>
<ul>
<li>From the group theoretical point of view, CFT are local field(quantum) construction of projective unitary representations of the conformal group(actually the local algebra, generated by infinitesimal transformations)</li>
<li>The combination of locality and unitarity is nontrivial.</li>
<li>For quantum theory, we actually need intrinsic projective representation(with central extension) to construct physical models.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conformal-transformations">Conformal transformations:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider the case of flat spacetime, the conformal transformations are defined to be those leaves metric invariant up to a spacetime dependent scale(preserving angles). This condition then lead to two useful constraint on infinitesimal conformal transformations.</li>
<li>In general the infinitesimal conformal transformations are generated by some vector fields(may be represented by differential operators), for d&gt;3, the situation is simpler, there are generators of translation, rotation &amp; boost, scale transformation, special conformal transformation. For d=2, the situation is more subtler, the local algebra(close under Lie bracket) is an infinite dimensional algebra, for Euclidean metric, it’s known as Witt alegebra, for Lorentzian metric, the Lie algebra is isomorphic to Witt algebra. The meaning of the conformal transformations are far more clear in d=2 Minkowski spacetime, they correspond to dilatation/contraction of the two independent light-cone coordinate axes, for d=2 Euclidean case, the finite conformal transformations correspond to linear complex analytic functions, especially the group PSL(2,C)(Mobius transformations). For the general case(including infinitesimal ones) ,this means the study of conformal transformations is reduced to the study of orientation-preserving diffeomorphism of R or S^{1} when compactified.</li>
<li>Not all infinitesimal conformal transformations can be exponentiated to be a finite transforamtion. There may be singularities as the obstructions. Those generator admitting finite transformations form a subalgebra, being the Lie algebra of the finite conformal transformations they form a group. There are two possibilies, when the infinity is excluded, we have less finite transformations, with infitnity included(we are compatictifying thus on a Riemann sphere/surface) there are more fninite transformations.</li>
<li>With more transformation, the system is more symmetric and thus more constraint. This means the physics of d=2 conformal field theories are highly constraint. The claim is that they are classfied by the central charge related to projective representations. Also note that the d=2 conformal field theory are very important in statistical physics and as the boundary of 2+1d topological bulk.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="confusions-and-thoughts">Confusions and thoughts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Is the compacitifed case, especially d=2 directly related to the knot theory and thus topological field theory?</li>
<li>Why in d=2 Lorentzian case, the group of (finite?) conformal transformations have infinite dimensional Lie algebra? Answer: in that case, the conformal transformations infer to all including infinitesimal ones, thus the Lie algebra is isomorphic to Witt algerba, not containing just finite ones that is related to Mobius transformations(PSL(2,C)).</li>
<li>The infinite dimensionality is consequential! Also note the infinite dimensionality of the Hilbert space in quantum mechanics. Also note the word “group” usually refer to some algebra: Lie algebra, Hopf algebra, etc. This is also similar for quantum groups.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Lecture 3,4</h1>
<h2 id="classical-cft">Classical CFT:</h2>
<ul>
<li>classical field theory with conformal symmetries is the construction with local field operators which transform under conformal transformations(finite(group) for d&gt;2, infinitesimal(algebra) for d=2) properly, i.e, it transform under conformal group as some reducible representation.(Note the field depends on spacetime coordinates, this is really a special representation! It is compatible with locality. But note here we assume such representation as field exist, it may not be possible to construct such reducible representations out of irreducible(usually finite dimensional) representations.). Classical symmetry refers to the invariance of the equation of motion.</li>
<li>With the help of differential operator(linear operator on Hilbert space, usually unbounded) representation of the generators(assume d&gt;2) we can obtain the classical Lie algebra of finite transformations. It contain the Poincare algebra as an important subalgebra. To find field representations, we try to find finite dimensional tensor representations first. We may use the representation of Poincare algebra as a ground, since any representation of conformal algebra must be a representation of the Poincare subalgebra, what left is to find their behavior under extra conformal transformations.</li>
<li>The result is that we use the method of induced representation, the little subgroup is defined as the subgroup leaving origin invariant, generated by Lorentz, dilation, SCTs generators. Since the Lorentz generators are represented irreducibly, form the Lie algebra(commutators) and the Schur’s lemma, we obtain the corresponding representation of dilation,SCT generator. The former is proportional to the identity, labeled by scaling dimension, the later vanishes. Thus all that is extra is dilation lead to a scaling bahavior. The general case is generated by action of translation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="quantum-cft">Quantum CFT:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The quantum version involve self-adjoint operators representing the generators, they are fully specified by eigenvalues, the general result is that the relevant eigenvalues are(the representation is labeled by) scaling dimension, spin, central charge(from projective representation thus central extension of the local algebra)</li>
<li>We then seek the consequence(constraint) of quantum conformal invariance, that is we assume we have constructed the relevant D.O.F and they transform under quantum conformal transformations such that the extended conformal algebra is furnished, and we consider the constraint of this invariance on physical quantities, especially the Green’s functions.</li>
<li>The locality in quantum cases are expressed as self-adjoint observables, labeled by spacetime and others, are jointly measurable, this requirement is expressed as space-like separation commutators vanishes. This is causality condition.</li>
<li>The relevant D.O.F is known as quasi-primary for finite conformal group or primary for conformal algebra. The latter is more constraint and may not even exist(luckily they do exist and the constraints are enough to solve them completely!) These objects(fields but may not standing for particles) transform under classical conformal transformations appropriately. This constraint on Green’s functions(correlation functions) is so strong that the 2-pt, 3-pt functions are determined to have a specific form, while the theory is indeed nontrivial since the higher functions are not fully determined, but they all must depend only on the cross ratios of distance. Note that the 2d case(algebras) is usually expressed in terms of complex variables, with the domain of Green’s functions analytically continued.</li>

<p>I found the PiTP 2015 contain rich materials on both field theory and topological matters given by the masters in these fields, I will include the notes taken from these lectures/talks here for future review.

I plan to watch those given by Dijkgraaf, Moore, Wen, Bernevig, Witten.</p>
<h1>Dijkgraaf: Introduction to topological field theory and conformal field theory</h1>
<h2 id="some-general-concepts">Some general concepts:</h2>
<ul>
<li>TQFT is a functor from cobordism to Hilbert space.</li>
<li>Boundary condition can be considered as defects(punctures) labeled by anyon(excitations), the axiom of TQFT give rise to the anyon algebra. There’s natural algebra defined on Hilbert space.  In 1+1 d, it is known as Frobenius algebra, in higher dimensions, for example 2+1 d the quantum groups are involved. The crucial building block is the pants(along with others like cylinder disc, they are sphere with 1,2,3 punctures/singularities), which is equivalent to 3-point vertex or anyon ring.</li>
<li>TQFT give rise to topological invariants(vacuum amplitude or states) of the spacetime manifold, note there’s no dynamics in TQFT.</li>
<li>SUSY QM and CFT can be formulated in the modified form: CFT have extra complex structure, SUSY have extra differential structure, analysis structure.</li>
<li>The boundary theory is mathematically rich, with the increase of the codimension, more complex mathematics are involved. For cod=1, we have Hilbert space, For cod=2, we have category of boundaries, for cod=3, we have 2-categories,… For example in string theory, the boundary condition problem is related to D-brane categories.</li>
<li>The diffeomorphism(ISO) of space manifold will produce projective representation over the Hilbert space. For example the Virasoro algebra(factor into two chiral(holomorphic and anti-holomorphic) algebra) will be represented on Hilbert space(infinite dimensional)</li>
<li>The CFT should be thought as depending only on complex structures, the metric is invariant up to scale, then the 1+1d CFT identify the equivalence(local rescaling) class of metric and the complex structure( the space to complex structures is known as moduli space). The space of all metric is in general infinite dimensional, but the moduli space(CFT) can be finite dimensional.</li>
<li>The CFT on S^1 can be considered as defined on cylinder or plane with singularities at origin and infinity or sphere with two singularities. These transformations are allowed since they have same complex structure(not the same metric) The states are then identified as the local operators at the origin or a infinite-long tube at the origin, with vacuum state identified with the disc. Then the vacuum expectation value of local operators are identified with the topological invariants for closed manifold with corresponding defects(boundary conditions)</li>
<li>To compute these invariants we may cut the manifold into building blocks and use the boundary condition to glue them, the boundary condition then captures the twisting, extanglement,…(all together gives global properties)</li>
<li>RCFT(rational) have extended chiral algebra, which is larger and thus a finite number of primary fields and finite dimensional representations. The will have extra symmetries which is related to topological gauge theories.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="chern-simons-theory">Chern-Simons theory:</h2>
<ul>
<li>classical C-S theory all have flat connection thus flat bundle, vanishing curvature thus contribute no energy.</li>
<li>To quantize C-S theory, a possible way is to identify the phase space which have a symplectic structure, the number of states can be obtained by Bohr-Sommerfield quantization. The canonical quantization need the identification of canonical variables.</li>
<li>The classical configuration space is defined by space of flat connections module the action of conjugation(gauge transformation) The flat connection can be obtained by homomorphism from fundamental group to G, group of holonomies.</li>
<li>The finite group case can be obtained also in this way. A important feature is that the TQFT algebra is furnished by the center of the group algebra.</li>
<li>The generalization involve the introduction of group cohomology, using pull back and classifying space/bundle. The cocycles have natural geometrical meanings attached to flat connection simplices.(lattice models)</li>

<ul>
<li>Total space is glued up piece by piece by transition functions(physically gauge transformations)</li>
<li>The topolohgical properties of fiber bundle will have physical meaning in gauge theory, especially the principle bundle(Fiber=Structure group) and topological configurations(monopole,instanton,…)</li>
<li>Quantum mechanics can be considered in fiber bundles: Hilbert space= projective space.Wave functions = sections of canonical complex line bundle.</li>
<li>Fields are sections of the corresponding fiber bundle.</li>
<li>vector bundles are related to principle bundles: using vector space(carrier space of the group we consider) and principle bundle we construct the associated vectore bundle, conversely we can construct associated principle bundle with vector bundle using reconstruction procedure. Examples include: Frame bundle and spin bundle.</li>
<li>H bundle over G/H can be considered as a group extension. The theory of group cohomology and group extension have geometrical interpretation as principle bundles and associated bundles.</li>

<h2 id="nakahara-connections-on-fiber-bundles">Nakahara: Connections on Fiber bundles</h2>
<p>Reading notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given principle bundle, geometrically we can uniquely separate the tangent space  into vertical part and  horizontal part with respect to the fiber G. This defines the E-connection naturally.</li>
<li>This then define the Lie algebra valued connection one form, whose image and kernal defines the separation properly.</li>
<li>Given local section, we can then pull back the connection one form to have a local connection one form on M, this defines the gauge potential. The requirement that the connection one form is unique, independent of covering then defines the compatibility condition of local connection, which is just the gauge transformation defined via transition function.</li>
<li>The definition of parallel transportation on principle bundle( transport both base point and its fiber) is then defined by horizontal lift of curves in base manifold. The horizontal lift depend on the definition of horizontal space, thus depend on connection.</li>
<li>The loops in base manifold induce horizontal lift which have closed base point but not the fiber element in general. This is then defines the holonomy group.The holonomy is known as Wilson loop or Berry phase. The holonomy group is a manifest of the curvature on principle bundle.</li>
<li>By defining covariant derivative on principle bundle via horizontal space(connection), the curvature two form is defined as the covariant derivative of the connection one form. The pull back by local section is the local curvature two form or gauge field strength. Whose local covariant derivative vanishes(Bianchi identity)</li>
<li>The holonomy(curvature) manifest the non trivial topological properties of the fiber bundle, which is also manifest by transition function and its homotopy group. Characteristic classes can be constructed from curvature.</li>
<li>The connection on principle bundle defines a natural covariant derivative of sections of the associated vector bundle, which defines how the fibers change in parallel transportation (the fiber is constant with respect to the horizontal lift) induced by the curve in base space. This definition of covariant derivative depend on only the section itself and connection on principle bundle, independent of both horizontal lift(which is not unique upon right action),and local trivialization( which is not unique upon left action(transition function)). The curvature can be expressed in terms of covariant derivative.</li>
<li>Gauge theories first relies on defining the right base manifold and fiber(as a group). The homotopy class of the bundle is manifested by the transition function(gauge transformation), characteristic class,… The physical degrees of freedom manifest as the associated vector bundle, with the section specifying both gauge D.O.F(principle bundle) and physical D.O.F(multiplet). The gauge bosons(connection itself) are defined with adjoint action(representation) and Lie algebra, while others are defined with other representations(action) and carrier vector spaces. The mod out right action is just gauge equivalence, with right action of gauge group on the fiber(both local gauge and multiplet) which is identified as the gauge transformation of both matter field and gauge field(on connection).</li>
<li>Many topological spaces can also be viewed as fiber bundles. The notion of twist(transition function/gauge transformation) is very important, also note that the independence of local trivialization, local coordinate system, covering, triangulation is very important.These are all expressed as certain equivalence relation and the these equivalence relation further define more constructions. The topological properties of many systems can be expressed explicitly in terms of fiber bundles and characteristic class(cohomology) and homotopy. The topological properties then is physically related to gauge theories! By triangulation, we then obtain lattice gauge theories.</li>
<li>examples include: Topological spaces like Mobius stripe, Gauge theories like Yang-Mills, General relativity, others like Berry phase, topological configurations(monopole,instanton,…)</li>

<h2 id="nakahara-characteristic-classes">Nakahara: Characteristic classes</h2>
<p>Reading notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The characteristic classes are defined to be subsets of cohomology class of the base space, which measure the (non)trivial property of both M and Fiber bundles over M.</li>
<li>For vector bundles the characteristic classes are defined to be functors from bundle to functors from the algebra of (adjiont) G-invariant polynomials  to the algebra of de Rham cohomology. Given certain invariant polynomial, the characteristic class is a functor form bundle to de Rham cohomology algebra.</li>
<li>For spin bundles the characteristic classes are defined via Cech cohomology group.</li>
<li>The classification of homotopy class of complex vector bundle can be turned into the classification homotopy class of smooth map from base space to the universal classifying space defined using Grassmann manifold which is also related to the classification of Clifford algebra. The characteristic classes of the classifying space pull back define characteristic classes of the fiber bundle.Which can be used to construct indicators of the homotopy class(topological invariants)</li>
<li>Useful characteristic classes include:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Complex vector bundle: Chern class, Chern character(important in index theorems), Todd class</li>
<li>Real vector bundle: Protrjagin class, Euler class(Gauss-Bonet:curvature—Euler character), L-polynomial, A-genus(Dirac genus).</li>
<li>Spin bundle: Stiefel-Whitney class(1st measure the (non)orientability, 2nd measure the possible spin bundle associated with the frame bundle(principle bundle associated with the tangent bundle endowed with a fiber metric)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Since the characteristic classes are closed(de Rham type), they are locally the exterior derivative of the Chern-Simons forms, defined via Chern-Weil theorem(transgression).</li>
<li>The local form of characteristic classes(de Rham type) only measure the local bundle, which is trivial. What is important is their integral over the base space, which is global. The integral can be turned into the integral over the boundary with Chern-Simons forms, which measure the topology(global) of the boundary manifold. This gives bulk-boundary correspondence.</li>

<p>都说密涅瓦的猫头鹰在黄昏起飞，怎么我到了晚上脑子就不带转的。</p>
<h1>2022/10/9</h1>
<p>最近学了Nakahara上纤维丛的三章，接下来整理一下，把老板的note和另外一个FIber bundle分类的note看一看。去学一下K理论基础，争取自己把十重分类搞明白。接下来还要整理一下群的上同调，把两部分结合一下学习整理，还有Clifford代数的内容没学。</p>
